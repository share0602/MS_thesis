To arrive at this theory, we observe that the edge theory of the Pfaffian state of bosons at v = 1 is an SU(2)2 Kac-Moody algebra. It follows that the corresponding bulk effective field theory is an SU(2) Chem-Simons theory with coupling constant k = 2. The effective field theories for other Pfaffian states, such as the fermionic one at v = 1/2 are obtained by a flux-attachment procedure. We discuss the non-Abelian statistics of quasiparticles in the context of this effective field theory.}},

	Abstract = {{Symmetry protected topological (SPT) states are short-range entangled states with symmetry. The boundary of a SPT phases has either gapless excitations or degenerate ground states, around a gapped bulk. Recently, we proposed a systematic construction of SPT phases in interacting bosonic systems, however it is not very clear what is the form of the low-energy excitations on the gapless edge. In this paper, we answer this question for two-dimensional (2D) bosonic SPT phases with ZN and U(1) symmetry. We find that while the low-energy modes of the gapless edges are nonchiral, symmetry acts on them in a ``chiral'' way, i.e., acts on the right movers and the left movers differently. This special realization of symmetry protects the gaplessness of the otherwise unstable edge states by prohibiting a direct scattering between the left and right movers. Moreover, understanding of the low-energy effective theory leads to experimental predictions about the SPT phases. In particular, we find that all the 2D U(1) SPT phases have even integer quantized Hall conductance.}},

	Abstract = {{Quantum many-body systems divide into a variety of phases with very different physical properties. The questions of what kinds of phases exist and how to identify them seem hard, especially for strongly interacting systems. Here we make an attempt to answer these questions for gapped interacting quantum spin systems whose ground states are short-range correlated. Based on the local unitary equivalence relation between short-range-correlated states in the same phase, we classify possible quantum phases for one-dimensional (1D) matrix product states, which represent well the class of 1D gapped ground states. We find that in the absence of any symmetry all states are equivalent to trivial product states, which means that there is no topological order in 1D. However, if a certain symmetry is required, many phases exist with different symmetry-protected topological orders. The symmetric local unitary equivalence relation also allows us to obtain some simple results for quantum phases in higher dimensions when some symmetries are present.}},

	Abstract = {{We give a classification of gapped quantum phases of one-dimensional systems in the framework of matrix product states (MPS) and their associated parent Hamiltonians, for systems with unique as well as degenerate ground states and in both the absence and the presence of symmetries. We find that without symmetries, all systems are in the same phase, up to accidental ground-state degeneracies. If symmetries are imposed, phases without symmetry breaking (i.e., with unique ground states) are classified by the cohomology classes of the symmetry group, that is, the equivalence classes of its projective representations, a result first derived by Chen, Gu, and Wen [Phys. Rev. B 83, 035107 (2011)PRBMDO1098-012110.1103/PhysRevB.83.035107]. For phases with symmetry breaking (i.e., degenerate ground states), we find that the symmetry consists of two parts, one of which acts by permuting the ground states, while the other acts on individual ground states, and phases are labeled by both the permutation action of the former and the cohomology class of the latter. Using projected entangled pair states (PEPS), we subsequently extend our framework to the classification of two-dimensional phases in the neighborhood of a number of important cases, in particular, systems with unique ground states, degenerate ground states with a local order parameter, and topological order. We also show that in two dimensions, imposing symmetries does not constrain the phase diagram in the same way it does in one dimension. As a central tool, we introduce the isometric form, a normal form for MPS and PEPS, which is a renormalization fixed point. Transforming a state to its isometric form does not change the phase, and thus we can focus on to the classification of isometric forms.}},

	Abstract = {{Quantum phases with different orders exist with or without breaking the symmetry of the system. Recently, a classification of gapped quantum phases which do not break time reversal, parity, or on-site unitary symmetry has been given for 1D spin systems by X. Chen, Z.-C. Gu, and X.-G. Wen [Phys. Rev. B 83, 035107 (2011)]. It was found that such symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases are labeled by the projective representations of the symmetry group which can be viewed as a symmetry fractionalization. In this paper, we extend the classification of 1D gapped phases by considering SPT phases with combined time reversal, parity, and/or on-site unitary symmetries and also the possibility of symmetry breaking. We clarify how symmetry fractionalizes with combined symmetries and also how symmetry fractionalization coexists with symmetry breaking. In this way, we obtain a complete classification of gapped quantum phases in 1D spin systems. We find that in general, symmetry fractionalization, symmetry breaking, and long-range entanglement (present in 2 or higher dimensions) represent three main mechanisms to generate a very rich set of gapped quantum phases. As an application of our classification, we study the possible SPT phases in 1D fermionic systems, which can be mapped to spin systems by Jordan-Wigner transformation.}},

For representative states of self-thermalizing systems, either eigenstates or states obtained by a long-time evolution of product states, negativity shows a sharp transition from an area-law scaling to a volume-law scaling when the subsystem volume fraction is tuned across a finite critical value. In contrast, for a system with quasiparticles, it exhibits a volume-law scaling irrespective of the subsystem fraction. For many-body localized systems, the same quantity shows an area-law scaling for eigenstates, and volume-law scaling for long-time-evolved product states, irrespective of the subsystem fraction. We provide a combination of numerical observations and analytical arguments in support of our conjecture.

Utilizing the recently developed dualities of gauge theories, we find these transitions can be described by critical bosons or gapless fermions coupled to emergent non-Abelian gauge fields, and the critical theories are of the type of a QCD3-Chern-Simons theory. We propose that all these exotic quantum phase transitions can potentially be direct and continuous in Kitaev materials, and we present sound evidence for this proposal. Therefore, besides being systems with intriguing quantum magnetism, Kitaev materials may also serve as table-top experimental platforms to study the interesting dynamics of emergent strongly interacting quarks and gluons in 2+1 dimensions.}},

	Abstract = {{It is an open question how well tensor network states in the form of an infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) tensor network can approximate gapless quantum states of matter. Here we address this issue for two different physical scenarios: (i) a conformally invariant (2+1)d quantum critical point in the incarnation of the transverse-field Ising model on the square lattice and (ii) spontaneously broken continuous symmetries with gapless Goldstone modes exemplified by the S=1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg and XY models on the square lattice. We find that the energetically best wave functions display finite correlation lengths and we introduce a powerful finite correlation length scaling framework for the analysis of such finite bond dimension (finite-D) iPEPS states. The framework is important (i) to understand the mild limitations of the finite-D iPEPS manifold in representing Lorentz-invariant, gapless many-body quantum states and (ii) to put forward a practical scheme in which the finite correlation length ξ(D) combined with field theory inspired formulas can be used to extrapolate the data to infinite correlation length, i.e., to the thermodynamic limit. The finite correlation length scaling framework opens the way for further exploration of quantum matter with an (expected) Lorentz-invariant, massless low-energy description, with many applications ranging from condensed matter to high-energy physics.}},

	Abstract = {{We show how to accurately study two-dimensional quantum critical phenomena using infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS). We identify the presence of a finite correlation length in the optimal iPEPS approximation to Lorentz-invariant critical states which we use to perform a finite correlation length scaling analysis to determine critical exponents. This is analogous to the one-dimensional finite entanglement scaling with infinite matrix product states. We provide arguments why this approach is also valid in 2D by identifying a class of states that, despite obeying the area law of entanglement, seems hard to describe with iPEPS. We apply these ideas to interacting spinless fermions on a honeycomb lattice and obtain critical exponents which are in agreement with quantum Monte Carlo results. Furthermore, we introduce a new scheme to locate the critical point without the need of computing higher-order moments of the order parameter. Finally, we also show how to obtain an improved estimate of the order parameter in gapless systems, with the 2D Heisenberg model as an example.}},

We obtain this result by applying a physical instantaneous cut to the gapped system and by viewing the cutting process as a sudden ``quantum quench'' into a conformal field theory, using the tools of boundary conformal field theory.

	Abstract = {{Two gapped quantum ground states in the same phase are connected by an adiabatic evolution which gives rise to a local unitary transformation that maps between the states. On the other hand, gapped ground states remain within the same phase under local unitary transformations. Therefore, local unitary transformations define an equivalence relation and the equivalence classes are the universality classes that define the different phases for gapped quantum systems. Since local unitary transformations can remove local entanglement, the above equivalence/universality classes correspond to pattern of long-range entanglement, which is the essence of topological order. The local unitary transformation also allows us to define a wave function renormalization scheme, under which a wave function can flow to a simpler one within the same equivalence/universality class. Using such a setup, we find conditions on the possible fixed-point wave functions where the local unitary transformations have finite dimensions. The solutions of the conditions allow us to classify this type of topological orders, which generalize the string-net classification of topological orders. We also describe an algorithm of wave function renormalization induced by local unitary transformations. The algorithm allows us to calculate the flow of tensor-product wave functions which are not at the fixed points. This will allow us to calculate topological orders as well as symmetry-breaking orders in a generic tensor-product state.}},

Here, we propose and analyze a universal toolbox of measurement protocols to reveal many-body topological invariants of phases with global symmetries, which can be implemented in state-of-the-art experiments with synthetic quantum systems, such as Rydberg atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting circuits. The protocol is based on extracting the many-body topological invariants from statistical correlations of randomized measurements, implemented with local random unitary operations followed by site-resolved projective measurements. We illustrate the technique and its application in the context of the complete classification of bosonic symmetry-protected topological phases in one dimension, considering in particular the extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger spin model, as realized with Rydberg tweezer arrays.}},

But it is still a challenging problem to generally detect it in a generic many-body state. In this paper, we will introduce a systematic numerical method based on tensor network to calculate modular matrices in two-dimensional systems, which can fully identify topological order with gapped edge. Moreover, it is shown numerically that modular matrices, including S and T matrices, are robust characterization to describe phase transitions between topologically ordered states and trivial states, which can work as topological order parameters. This method only requires local information of one ground state in the form of a tensor network, and directly provides the universal data (S and T matrices), without any nonuniversal contributions. Furthermore, it is generalizable to higher dimensions. Unlike calculating topological entanglement entropy by extrapolating, in which numerical complexity is exponentially high, this method extracts a much more complete set of topological data (modular matrices) with much lower numerical cost.}},

	Abstract = {{Abelian and non-Abelian topological phases exhibiting protected chiral edge modes are ubiquitous in the realm of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect. Here, we investigate a spin-1 Hamiltonian on the square lattice which could, potentially, host the spin liquid analog of the (bosonic) non-Abelian Moore-Read FQH state, as suggested by exact diagonalization of small clusters. Using families of fully SU(2)-spin symmetric and translationally invariant chiral projected entangled pair states (PEPS), variational energy optimization is performed using infinite-PEPS methods, providing good agreement with density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) results. A careful analysis of the bulk spin-spin and dimer-dimer correlation functions in the optimized spin liquid suggests that they exhibit long-range ``gossamer tails''. From the investigation of the entanglement spectrum, we observe sharply defined chiral edge modes following the prediction of the SU(2)2 Wess-Zumino-Witten theory and exhibiting a conformal field theory (CFT) central charge c=3/2, as expected for a Moore-Read chiral spin liquid. Using the PEPS bulk-edge correspondence, we argue the ``weak'' criticality of the bulk is in fact a finite-D artifact of the chiral PEPS, which quickly becomes (practically) irrelevant as the PEPS bond dimension D is increased. We conclude that the PEPS formalism offers an unbiased and efficient method to investigate non-Abelian chiral spin liquids in quantum antiferromagnets.}},

Here we quantify the entanglement in one-dimensional topological states by showing that local quantum circuits of linear depth are necessary to generate them from product states. We establish this linear lower bound for both bosonic and fermionic one-dimensional topological phases and use symmetric circuits for phases with symmetry. We also show that the linear lower bound can be saturated by explicitly constructing circuits generating these topological states. The same results hold for local quantum circuits connecting topological states in different phases.}},

	Abstract = {{Neural network-based machine learning has recently proven successful for many complex applications ranging from image recognition to precision medicine. However, its direct application to problems in quantum physics is challenging due to the exponential complexity of many-body systems. Motivated by recent advances in realizing quantum information processors, we introduce and analyse a quantum circuit-based algorithm inspired by convolutional neural networks, a highly effective model in machine learning. Our quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) uses only O(log(N)) variational parameters for input sizes of N qubits, allowing for its efficient training and implementation on realistic, near-term quantum devices. To explicitly illustrate its capabilities, we show that QCNNs can accurately recognize quantum states associated with a one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological phase, with performance surpassing existing approaches. We further demonstrate that QCNNs can be used to devise a quantum error correction scheme optimized for a given, unknown error model that substantially outperforms known quantum codes of comparable complexity. The potential experimental realizations and generalizations of QCNNs are also discussed. A quantum circuit-based algorithm inspired by convolutional neural networks is shown to successfully perform quantum phase recognition and devise quantum error correcting codes when applied to arbitrary input quantum states.}},

	Abstract = {{We show that quantum systems of extended objects naturally give rise to a large class of exotic phases---namely topological phases. These phases occur when extended objects, called ``string-nets,'' become highly fluctuating and condense. We construct a large class of exactly soluble 2D spin Hamiltonians whose ground states are string-net condensed. Each ground state corresponds to a different parity invariant topological phase. The models reveal the mathematical framework underlying topological phases: tensor category theory. One of the Hamiltonians---a spin-1∕2 system on the honeycomb lattice---is a simple theoretical realization of a universal fault tolerant quantum computer. The higher dimensional case also yields an interesting result: we find that 3D string-net condensation naturally gives rise to both emergent gauge bosons and emergent fermions. Thus, string-net condensation provides a mechanism for unifying gauge bosons and fermions in 3 and higher dimensions.}},

Guided by extensive exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group calculations, we construct an optimized symmetric PEPS for a SU(3)1 chiral spin liquid on the square lattice. Characteristic features are revealed by the entanglement spectrum (ES) on an infinitely long cylinder. In all three Z3 sectors, the level counting of the linear dispersing modes is in full agreement with SU(3)1 Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory prediction. Special features in the ES are shown to be in correspondence with bulk anyonic correlations, indicating a fine structure in the holographic bulk-edge correspondence.

	Abstract = {{Symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases are gapped short-range-entangled quantum phases with a symmetry G. They can all be smoothly connected to the same trivial product state if we break the symmetry. The Haldane phase of spin-1 chain is the first example of SPT phases which is protected by SO(3) spin rotation symmetry. The topological insulator is another example of SPT phases which are protected by U(1) and time-reversal symmetries. In this paper, we show that interacting bosonic SPT phases can be systematically described by group cohomology theory: Distinct d-dimensional bosonic SPT phases with on-site symmetry G (which may contain antiunitary time-reversal symmetry) can be labeled by the elements in H1+d[G,UT(1)], the Borel (1+d)-group-cohomology classes of G over the G module UT(1). Our theory, which leads to explicit ground-state wave functions and commuting projector Hamiltonians, is based on a new type of topological term that generalizes the topological θ term in continuous nonlinear σ models to lattice nonlinear σ models. The boundary excitations of the nontrivial SPT phases are described by lattice nonlinear σ models with a nonlocal Lagrangian term that generalizes the Wess-Zumino-Witten term for continuous nonlinear σ models. As a result, the symmetry G must be realized as a non-on-site symmetry for the low-energy boundary excitations, and those boundary states must be gapless or degenerate. As an application of our result, we can use H1+d[U(1)⋊Z2T,UT(1)] to obtain interacting bosonic topological insulators (protected by time reversal Z2T and boson number conservation), which contain one nontrivial phase in one-dimensional (1D) or 2D and three in 3D. We also obtain interacting bosonic topological superconductors (protected by time-reversal symmetry only), in term of H1+d[Z2T,UT(1)], which contain one nontrivial phase in odd spatial dimensions and none for even dimensions. Our result is much more general than the above two examples, since it is for any symmetry group. For example, we can use H1+d[U(1)×Z2T,UT(1)] to construct the SPT phases of integer spin systems with time-reversal and U(1) spin rotation symmetry, which contain three nontrivial SPT phases in 1D, none in 2D, and seven in 3D. Even more generally, we find that the different bosonic symmetry breaking short-range-entangled phases are labeled by the following three mathematical objects: (GH,GΨ,H1+d[GΨ,UT(1)]), where GH is the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian and GΨ the symmetry group of the ground states.}},

	Abstract = {{Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with gapless edge excitations have been shown to exist in strongly interacting bosonic/fermionic systems and it is highly desirable to identify practical systems realizing such phases through numerical simulation. A central question to be addressed is how to determine the SPT order in the system given the simulation result, while no local order parameter can be measured to distinguish the phases from a trivial one. In the tensor network approach to simulate strongly interacting systems, the quantum state renormalization algorithm has been shown to be effective in identifying intrinsic topological orders. Here, we show that a modified algorithm can identify SPT orders by extracting the symmetry-protected fixed point entanglement pattern in the ground-state wave function, which is essential for the existence of SPT order. The key to this approach is to add proper symmetry protection to the renormalization process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm with examples of nontrivial SPT phases with internal symmetry in 1D and internal and translation symmetry in 2D.}},

The SPT phases in free fermion systems, such as topological insulators, can be classified; however, it is not known what SPT phases exist in general interacting systems. We present a systematic way to construct SPT phases in interacting bosonic systems.

	Abstract = {{It has recently been shown that in every spatial dimension there exist precisely five distinct classes of topological insulators or superconductors. Within a given class, the different topological sectors can be distinguished, depending on the case, by a  or a  topological invariant. This is an exhaustive classification. Here we construct representatives of topological insulators and superconductors for all five classes and in arbitrary spatial dimension d, in terms of Dirac Hamiltonians. Using these representatives we demonstrate how topological insulators (superconductors) in different dimensions and different classes can be related via 'dimensional reduction' by compactifying one or more spatial dimensions (in 'Kaluza--Klein'-like fashion). For -topological insulators (superconductors) this proceeds by descending by one dimension at a time into a different class. The -topological insulators (superconductors), on the other hand, are shown to be lower-dimensional descendants of parent -topological insulators in the same class, from which they inherit their topological properties. The eightfold periodicity in dimension d that exists for topological insulators (superconductors) with Hamiltonians satisfying at least one reality condition (arising from time-reversal or charge-conjugation/particle--hole symmetries) is a reflection of the eightfold periodicity of the spinor representations of the orthogonal groups SO(N) (a form of Bott periodicity). Furthermore, we derive for general spatial dimensions a relation between the topological invariant that characterizes topological insulators and superconductors with chiral symmetry (i.e., the winding number) and the Chern--Simons invariant. For lower-dimensional cases, this formula relates the winding number to the electric polarization (d=1 spatial dimensions) or to the magnetoelectric polarizability (d=3 spatial dimensions). Finally, we also discuss topological field theories describing the spacetime theory of linear responses in topological insulators (superconductors) and study how the presence of inversion symmetry modifies the classification of topological insulators (superconductors).}},

	Abstract = {{We show that topology can protect exponentially localized, zero energy edge modes at critical points between one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological phases. This is possible even without gapped degrees of freedom in the bulk---in contrast to recent work on edge modes in gapless chains. We present an intuitive picture for the existence of these edge modes in the case of noninteracting spinless fermions with time-reversal symmetry (BDI class of the tenfold way). The stability of this phenomenon relies on a topological invariant defined in terms of a complex function, counting its zeros and poles inside the unit circle. This invariant can prevent two models described by the same conformal field theory (CFT) from being smoothly connected. A full classification of critical phases in the noninteracting BDI class is obtained: Each phase is labeled by the central charge of the CFT, c∈12N, and the topological invariant, ω∈Z. Moreover, c is determined by the difference in the number of edge modes between the phases neighboring the transition. Numerical simulations show that the topological edge modes of critical chains can be stable in the presence of interactions and disorder.}},

	Abstract = {{Topological insulators in free fermion systems have been well characterized and classified. However, it is not clear in strongly interacting boson or fermion systems what symmetry-protected topological orders exist. In this paper, we present a model in a two-dimensional (2D) interacting spin system with nontrivial onsite Z2 symmetry-protected topological order. The order is nontrivial because we can prove that the one-dimensional (1D) system on the boundary must be gapless if the symmetry is not broken, which generalizes the gaplessness of Wess-Zumino-Witten model for Lie symmetry groups to any discrete symmetry groups. The construction of this model is related to a nontrivial 3-cocycle of the Z2 group and can be generalized to any symmetry group. It potentially leads to a complete classification of symmetry-protected topological orders in interacting boson and fermion systems of any dimension. Specifically, this exactly solvable model has a unique gapped ground state on any closed manifold and gapless excitations on the boundary if Z2 symmetry is not broken. We prove the latter by developing the tool of a matrix product unitary operator to study the nonlocal symmetry transformation on the boundary and reveal the nontrivial 3-cocycle structure of this transformation. Similar ideas are used to construct a 2D fermionic model with onsite Z2 symmetry-protected topological order.}},

We argue that, in three dimensions, this model has deconfined quasiparticles supporting Majorana zero modes obeying nontrivial statistics. We introduce two effective field theory descriptions of this deconfined phase in which the excitations have Coulomb interactions. A key feature of this system is the existence of topologically nontrivial fermionic excitations, called ``Hopfions'' because, in a suitable continuum limit of the dimer model, such excitations correspond to the Hopf map and are related to excitations identified by Ran et al.

We identify corresponding topological invariants of the quantum dimer model (with or without fermions) that are present even on lattices with trivial topology. The Hopfion energy gap depends upon the phase of the model.

	Abstract = {A spin-1/2 system on a honeycomb lattice is studied. The interactions between nearest neighbors are of XX, YY or ZZ type, depending on the direction of the link; different types of interactions may differ in strength. The model is solved exactly by a reduction to free fermions in a static Z2 gauge field. A phase diagram in the parameter space is obtained. One of the phases has an energy gap and carries excitations that are Abelian anyons. The other phase is gapless, but acquires a gap in the presence of magnetic field. In the latter case excitations are non-Abelian anyons whose braiding rules coincide with those of conformal blocks for the Ising model. We also consider a general theory of free fermions with a gapped spectrum, which is characterized by a spectral Chern number ν. The Abelian and non-Abelian phases of the original model correspond to ν=0 and ν=$\pm$1, respectively. The anyonic properties of excitation depend on ν mod 16, whereas ν itself governs edge thermal transport. The paper also provides mathematical background on anyons as well as an elementary theory of Chern number for quasidiagonal matrices.},

	Abstract = {We study topological phase transitions in discrete gauge theories in two spatial dimensions induced by the formation of a Bose condensate. We analyse a general class of euclidean lattice actions for these theories which contain one coupling constant for each conjugacy class of the gauge group. To probe the phase structure we use a complete set of open and closed anyonic string operators. The open strings allow one to determine the particle content of the condensate, whereas the closed strings enable us to determine the matrix elements of the modular S-matrix, in both the unbroken and broken phases. From the measured broken S-matrix we may read off the sectors that split or get identified in the broken phase, as well as the sectors that are confined. In this sense the modular S-matrix can be employed as a matrix valued nonlocal order parameter from which the low-energy effective theories that occur in different regions of parameter space can be fully determined. To verify our predictions, we studied a non-abelian anyon model based on the quaternion group of the order of eight by Monte Carlo simulation. We probe part of the phase diagram for the pure gauge theory and find a variety of phases with magnetic condensates leading to various forms of (partial) confinement in complete agreement with the algebraic breaking analysis. Also the order of various transitions is established.},
